The previous example showed you\n  how to do that.\n  You can also make animation frames from individual images files.\n  Just feed the sprite any array containing the image files that you\n  want to use for each frame.\n  (The best way to make a sprite with multiple frames is to use a \n  texture atlas - see the next example.)\n  */   \n\n  //You can make a sprite from an array of images, like this:\n  pixie = g.sprite([\n    \"images/pixie0.png\",\n    \"images/pixie1.png\",\n    \"images/pixie2.png\"\n  ]);\n  \n  //You can control the sprites using the same methods and properties\n  //you learned in the previous example.\n\n  //Use the `playAnimation` method to play the pixie's frames.\n  //The animation will loop unless you set the sprite's `loop`\n  //property to `false`.
