/*
This example illustrates how you can use `addChild` and
`removeChild` to make sprites the children of other sprites.
All sprites have local and global x and y coordinates. The local
coordinates, `x` and `y`, are relative to the top left corner of the
sprite's parent. The global coordinates, `gx` and `gy` are relative
to the top left corner of the `stage`. (The `stage` is the root
container that contains all the sprites in the game.)

  //square will now be at its center.
